# compress-image-swift

This is a basic project made to test an basic algorithm to compress image in swift 4

This project basically will read a photo from the galery and then force to reach a given size in kb.

to do so it will limit to a A4 size the photo and reduce the photo quality until half of the maximum and then it will reduce in 10% the maximum size.
until it reach the desired size.
